This is a masters thesis project. 

with the progress of technology and the widespread use of the internet phishing has emerged as a growing danger. Phishing entails tricking people into disclosing information. Appears in different guises such, as email phishing text message phishing, and vishing (voice phishing). This project seeks to tackle the increasing issue of phishing by utilizing data analysis and machine learning to identify and forecast phishing websites. The research suggests a strategy that involves machine learning techniques such, as Support Vector Machine (SVM) Decision Tree (DT) Random Forest (RF) K nearest Neighbours (KNN) extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and a stacking classifier that merges XGBoost and Random Forest together. 


The dataset employed in this project was gotten from Mendeley Data. it comprises of over 200,000 instances and 30 features comprising of both phishing and legitimate websites. The target variable being either 0 (legitimate) or 1 (Phishing).
